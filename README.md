# HQ â€“ Branch Network Design and Configuration with IPv4/IPv6 and Routing Protocols

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project focuses on the **design and configuration of a network for HQ and Branch sites** using both IPv4 and IPv6.  
The main objective is to build a complete network model and implement various routing protocols, tunneling techniques, switching features, and network services.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Contents

1. **Theoretical Background**

   - IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
   - Routing protocols: EIGRP, OSPF
   - PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), GRE Tunnel
   - NAT, DHCP, DHCPv6
   - Switching: VLAN, STP, EtherChannel

2. **Proposed Model**

   - HQ and Branch topology
   - IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes
   - IP allocation for HQ and Branch networks

3. **Configuration**

   - PPP connections with PAP and CHAP authentication
   - GRE Tunneling
   - IPv4 and IPv6 routing with EIGRP and OSPF
   - VTP, VLAN, STP, and EtherChannel configuration
   - NAT, DHCP (IPv4/IPv6) setup
   - Access control for SSH and VLAN restrictions

4. **Results**
   - Stable IPv4/IPv6 routing operations
   - VLAN communication via Router-on-a-Stick
   - Automatic IP assignment with DHCP
   - Basic security policies for internal access

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
